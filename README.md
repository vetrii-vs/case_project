Project Description:-

The Court Case Management System is a simple web-based application developed to manage court case records digitally. The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete court case details through a REST-based backend developed using Spring Boot.

The backend application uses an H2 in-memory database to store case information, which makes the system lightweight and easy to configure without the need for an external database. The application follows a layered architecture using Entity, Repository, and Controller components.

To demonstrate DevOps practices, the project is maintained in a GitHub repository and uses GitHub Actions to automate the build process. The frontend of the application is deployed on Vercel, while the backend is deployed on a cloud platform, enabling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

This project helps in understanding full-stack development, RESTful services, database integration, and DevOps automation in a simple and practical manner.
